# The Material Model Laboratory

## New Version Notice

Matmodlab has been superceded by [Matmodlab2](https://github.com/tjfulle/matmodlab2).  Please use this updated version.
Matmodlab will not be mainted/developed any further.

## What is it?

The material model laboratory (*matmodlab*) is a material point simulator developed as a tool for developing and analyzing material models for use in larger finite element codes.

## System Requirements

*matmodlab* has been built and tested extensively on several versions of linux
and the Apple Mac OSX 10.8 operating systems.

### Required Software

*matmodlab* requires the following software installed for your platform:

- [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org) or newer

- [Numpy 1.8](http://www.numpy.org) or newer

- [Scipy 0.13](http://www.scipy.org) or newer

*matmodlab* is developed and tested using both the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io) and [Enthought](http://www.enthought.com) Python distributions.  We recommend using one of the two, instead of building and installing Numpy and Scipy manually.

### Optional Software

  - Fortran compiler

## Installation

  Execute `python setup.py develop` in this directory
